//    Although the switch statement was borrowed from other languages, it has some unique characteristics
//    in ECMAScript. First, the switch statement works with all data types (in many languages it works
//    only with numbers), so it can be used with strings and even with objects. Second, the case values need
//    not be constants; they can be variables and even expressions.
    // Consider the following example:
    <title>Switch Statement Example 3</title>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        switch ("hello world") {
            case "hello" + " world": 
                alert("Greeting was found.");
                break;
            case "goodbye": 
                alert("Closing was found.");
                break;
            default: 
                alert("Unexpected message was found.");
        }

    </script>


//    In this example, a string value is used in a switch statement. The fi rst case is actually an expression
//    that evaluates a string concatenation. Because the result of this concatenation is equal to the switch
//    argument, the alert displays “Greeting was found.”
