    <title>Relational Operators Example 1</title>


    <!--When a relational operator is used on two strings, an interesting behavior occurs.
    Many expect-->
    <!--that less-than means “alphabetically before” and greater-than means
    “alphabetically after,” but-->
    <!--this is not the case. For strings, each of the first string’s character
    codes is numerically compared-->
    <!--against the character codes in a corresponding location in the second string.
    After this comparison-->
    <!--is complete, a Boolean value is returned. The problem here is that the character codes of uppercase-->
    <!--letters are all lower than the character codes of lowercase letters, meaning that you can run into-->
    <!--situations like this:-->
    <!--var result = “Brick” < “alphabet”; //true-->
    <!--In this example, the string “Brick” is considered to be less than the string “alphabet”, because-->
    <!--the letter B has a character code of 66 and the letter a has a character code of 97. To force a true-->
    <!--alphabetic result, you must convert both operands into a common case (upper or lower) and then-->
    <!--compare like this:-->
    <!--var result = “Brick”.toLowerCase() < “alphabet”.toLowerCase(); //false-->
    <!--Converting both operands to lowercase ensures that “alphabet” is correctly identified as-->
    <!--alphabetically before “Brick”.-->
    <!--Another sticky situation occurs when comparing numbers that are strings, such as in this example:-->
    <!--var result = “23” < “3”; //true-->
    <!--This code returns true when comparing the string “23” to “3”. Because both operands are strings,-->
    <!--they are compared by their character codes (the character code for “2” is 50;
    the character code for-->
    <!--“3” is 51). If, however, one of the operands is changed to a number as in the following example, the-->
    <!--result makes more sense:-->
    <!--var result = “23” < 3; //false-->
    <!--Here, the string “23” is converted into the number 23 and then compared to 3, giving the expected-->
    <!--result. Whenever a number is compared to a string, the string is converted into a number and then-->
    <!--numerically compared to the other number. This works well for cases like
    the previous example, but-->
    <!--what if the string can’t be converted into a number? Consider this example:-->
    <!--var result = “a” < 3; //false because “a” becomes NaN-->
    <!--The letter “a” can’t be meaningfully converted into a number, so it becomes NaN. As a rule, the-->
    <!--result of any relational operation with NaN is false, which is interesting when considering the-->
    <!--following:-->
    <!--var result1 = NaN < 3; //false-->
    <!--var result2 = NaN >= 3; //false-->
    <!--In most comparisons, if a value is not less than another, it is always greater than or equal to it.-->
    <!--When using NaN, however, both comparisons return false.-->

        var result2 = 5 < 3;    //false
        var result3 = "Brick" < "alphabet";  //true
        var result4 = "Brick".toLowerCase() < "alphabet".toLowerCase();  //false
        var result5 = "23" < "3";
        var result6 = "23" < 3;
        var result7 = "a" < 3;
